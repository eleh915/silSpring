            <p>GREATER AWARENESS</p>
            <p2>About 15% of people know that there are warning labels on insecticide sprays, and even fewer read or heed them. For this reason, it would be beneficial to begin educational campaigns alerting Americans—especially farmers—about insecticides’ harms. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), many farmers spray more than the maximum recommended amount of insecticide, or “insecticide tolerance.”</p2>

            <p>INCREASED GOVERNMENTAL OVERSIGHT</p>
            <p2>It is difficult for the government to regulate the amount of chemicals sprayed onto plants because of how few inspectors there. Less than one percent of fields can be properly monitored, making it easy for farmers to overspray crops and introduce chemicals like dieldrin, endrin, and DDT into animals’ or humans’ diets. It is of no use for the government to create these insecticide tolerances if farmers are not going to abide by them. Thus, the government is in dire need of hiring more workers to police both interstate and intrastate commerce. It also should clamp down on violators and hold farmers accountable for the illnesses resulting on account of their poor practices.</p2>

            <p>CONSERVATION OF VARIETY</p>
            <p2>Charles Elton once postulated that plants and animals could best flourish in an ecosystem characterized by “conservation of variety.” Today, his words still ring true, but we are failing to heed them. By lining fields or filling towns with one species of, say, tree, such as was done with the elm, we are asking for a calamity. This kind of landscape makes it easy for diseases to sweep through and kill off entire populations of species. For this reason, we need to ensure biodiversity in our ecosystems.</p2>

            <p>SELECTIVE SPRAYING</p>
            <p2>Increasingly, it is becoming common practice to spray the same fields multiple times in a year, which allows the amount of poisonous residue to build up. Selective spraying provides an alternative because it only needs to be done once. It has been proven to be successful in trials because of nature’s inherent stability. Suppose one species needs to be eliminated and is treated with the spray; it is possible to avoid retreatment by letting the other species in the ecosystem “assert control,” as Carson says. This underscores the necessity of biodiversity—of letting other species flourish in cooperation with one another. Selective spraying saves taxpayers money by eliminating the cost of subsequent sprays and decreases the amount of harm to humans and their environment.</p2>
