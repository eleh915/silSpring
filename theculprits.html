    <div class="different-killers">
        <a name="ddt">
            <p>DDT</p>
            <p2>The average human has approximately 6.3 parts per million of DDT within him. The ways in which DDT accumulates within us varies widely, but mostly involves some form of transfer. For instance, DDT may be dusted onto alfalfa, which hens then consume in alfalfa-laden hen meal. If humans eat these hens’ eggs, they will increase their store of DDT in organs like the thyroid, adrenals, and testes. Because spraying DDT multiple times a year on the same field is common practice, DDT residue accrues rapidly.</p2>
        </a>
        <a name="arsenic">
            <p>ARSENIC</p>
            <p2>Though many are aware of arsenic’s toxic nature, few realize that farmers continue to use arsenic dusts on their crops, which has led to livestock death and human sickness. A single farmer who uses an arsenic-containing spray can affect an array of fields as the dust spreads. This is part of the reason why the beekeeping industry is almost nonexistent in the southern U.S.—the bees have been killed off by poisonous arsenic sprays. Additionally, due to arsenic accumulation in the soil, even in areas where arsenic sprays are no longer used tobacco plants can still acquire it (a phenomenon called "permanent poisoning").</p2>
        </a>
        <a name="parathion">
            <p>PARATHION</p>
            <p2>Swallowing small dosages of parathion is so lethal that Finns have used it to commit suicide. For bees, even touching it can preempt paralysis or death. About seven million pounds of parathion are spread onto U.S. fields via techniques like dusting. A fraction of this amount is applied to fields in California fields, and yet it is still enough to kill the world’s population five to ten times over. In combination with other organic phosphates, parathion can become even more potent.</p2>
        </a>
        <a name="overproduction">
            <p>OVERPRODUCTION</p>
            <p2>Farmers justify using pesticides to oversee farm production, but in reality it engenders the twin problem of overproduction. Though many Americans may not know it, overproduction is a huge expense that they pay for with their tax dollars. Fifty years ago, the program to store excess foodstuffs cost Americans more than one billion dollars.</p2>
        </a>
        <a name="strontium90">
            <p>STRONTIUM 90</p>
            <p2>Strontium is particularly harmful because of the ease in which it accumulates in human beings’ bone marrow. It often results from radiation or nuclear fallout, descending from above on soil, wheat, grass, or other foodstuffs. After humans consume the Strontium, it lodges in their bones and stays there for the rest of their lives.</p2>
        </a>
        <a name="urethane">
            <p>URETHANE</p>
            <p2>Like Strontium, urethane is a mutagen with life-threatening effects. It is also a carbamate, which may be found in insecticides, fungicides, clothing, medicine, and insulating material. Despite the fact that it is found in common household items such as these, urethane is a proven cancer-causer. For infants, there is even the risk of tumor formation via prenatal exposure to urethane.</p2>
        </a>
        <a name="chemicals">
            <p>CHEMICALS</p>
            <p2>Each year, about 500 chemicals are introduced across the nation. These are particularly dangerous because humans’ and animals’ bodies are not yet accustomed to them. The facility with which they enter the market indicates that they may not have been adequately tested, and so there is potential for these chemicals to cause sickness or mutate genes. It is important to note that combinations of chemicals can be far deadlier than the sum of their individual toxicities. For example, combining methoxychlor—which is generally deemed to be safe—with another chemical in the liver may mimic DDT in the outcome it will have on the nervous system.</p2>
        </a>
        <a name="chemicalsprays">
            <p>CHEMICAL SPRAYS</p>
            <p2>Though chemical sprays may be intended to eradicate a specific plant, there is always the possibility that they will negatively affect entirely different ecological populations. In Wyoming’s Bridger National Forest, the United States Forest Service sprayed 10,000 acres of sagelands, eliminating not only the sage, but the willows, too. Without the willows, the moose and beavers feeding on the willows left; without the beavers, there was no one to maintain the dam; without the dam, the lake drained away; and without the lake, the trout could not flourish. In this way, chemical sprays may set off a chain reaction that utterly depopulates a landscape.</p2>

        <a name="syntheticinsecticides">
            <p>SYNTHETIC INSECTICIDES</p>
            <p2>Synthetic insecticides are able to dramatically alter how the human body functions. For example, they can set cells on a course towards malignancy, or target enzymes whose role it is to safeguard humans from disease. The number of synthetic pesticides in the U.S. is rapidly increasing; Rachel Carson noted that in 1960 more than 600 billion pounds of synthetic insecticides were manufactured.</p2>
        </a>
        <a name="systemicinsecticides">
            <p>SYSTEMIC INSECTICIDES</p>
            <p2>Some chemicals of the organophosphorus or chlorinated hydrocarbon groups are systemic insecticides. They get the name “systemic” from the fact that they infiltrate and poison plant and animal tissues, thereby affecting the entire bodily system. Their toxicity is also easily transferrable: from carbon seeds to plants to the plants’ seedlings to insects, and so on. There are reported cases of workers becoming ill after handling seeds affected by systemic insecticides.</p2>
        </a>
        <a name="chlordane">
            <p>CHLORDANE</p>
            <p2>There are recorded examples of chlordane as both an immediate and long-term killer. After it is swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed onto the skin, it can multiply within the body. Despite the FDA’s assertion that chlordane sprayed in a house poses a “very great” threat, people routinely apply it to their lawns in the form of crabgrass killers. One of these products, Carson laments, recommends that the user apply what amounts to 60 pounds of technical chlordane to their lawns. This can have devastating effects on birds in the surrounding area.</p2>
        </a>
        <a name="aldrin">
            <p>ALDRIN</p>
            <p2>Aldrin is a chlorinated hydrocarbon that researchers have shown to be up to 300 times more toxic than DDT (in tests on quail). Because of its relative cheapness, it was used to dust about 27,000 acres in Michigan. This plan was proposed in order to wipe out the Japanese beetle population, but its effects far exceeded all intentions. Dogs got sick, cats went into convulsions, and birds died in the immediate aftermath of the program. The brash decision to rain aldrin down on the population of Michigan may have also had ramifications on humans, with some reporting symptoms such as nausea and severe fatigue.</p2>
        </a>
        <a name="dieldrin">
            <p>DIELDRIN</p>
            <p2>An accumulation of dieldrin stored in the body puts the liver and nervous system at considerable risk. It has been shown to have effects that may strike quickly and unexpectedly, as in the case of a man whose dieldrin metabolized as a result of weight loss. Sadly, dieldrin is one of the most commonly used insecticides despite its toxicity.</p2>
        </a>
        <a name="endrin">
            <p>ENDRIN</p>
            <p2>Endrin is five times as poisonous as dieldrin and 300 times as poisonous as DDT to particular types of birds. It is incredibly toxic, as exemplified by the case of an American baby who became comatose after his home in Venezuela was sprayed with a product containing endrin. Like dieldrin and aldrin, it is a chlorinated hydrocarbon, but it differs from them in that it is deadlier than both. Sharp declines in fish and livestock populations are testaments to endrin’s noxiousness.</p2>
