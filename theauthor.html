            <p>RACHEL CARSON</p>
            <p2>Rachel Carson was an environmentalist whose work in the early to mid-twentieth century helped raise awareness of various ecological issues, including pesticide use. After graduating from Chatham University, she worked for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries while writing nature pieces for the Baltimore Sun. Eventually, she rose in the ranks to become Editor-in-Chief of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s publication department. She took particular interest in subjects such as oceanography and conservation, which translated into her writing <i>Under the Sea-wind</i> and <i>The Sea Around Us</i>. Two years before her death, in 1962, she penned <i>Silent Spring</i>. This constituted a change in direction for Carson, who was now primarily focused on studying chemical and pesticide use. Though she received criticism from some members of the U.S. government, she  mainly was lauded for opening the world’s eyes to the potential detriments of excessive and unnatural chemical spraying. For her efforts, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p2>
